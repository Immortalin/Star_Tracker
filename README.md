# Star Tracker

Star Tracker development for SUCHAI 2 - 3. <br />
SUCHAI 1 is the first NanoSatellite developed at Universidad de Chile, in the 
Space and Planetary Exploration Laboratory (SPEL). Currently, we are working in two more NanoSats, the SUCHAI 2 & 3. [More info](http://spel.ing.uchile.cl).

## Description

- This is a fully functional Star Tracker (ST) for use with a Raspberry Pi. <br />
- This code is written in _Python_. All the code and the necessary files are in the __RPI__ folder. <br />
- This Git-Hub is free and open to everyone interested in using it, __especially researchers working on CubeSats!__. <br />

## Instructions for use

1. This ST code is based on two open softwares: __Source Extractor__ and __Match__. In order to use it, you need this two software first.<br />
    1.1. Get [Source Extractor](https://www.astromatic.net/software/sextractor). <br />
    1.2. Get [Match](http://spiff.rit.edu/match/). We use __version 0.14__ in our _Python_ program. <br />
    1.3. Install this two programs in your RPI. <br />

2. Clone this repository in any folder on your RPI, for example: /home/pi/Desktop/ST/

3. Run in _Python_ the file _StarTracker_10deg.py_. By default, it will use a picture from __RPI/Sample_Images/__. You can test with other pictures, or use your own taked with a RPI Camera.
