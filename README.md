## Description

- This is a fully functional Star Tracker for use with a Raspberry Pi and its camera. <br />
- This code is written in _Python_. All the code and the necessary files are in the __RPI__ folder. <br />
- This Git-Hub is __free__ and __open__ to everyone interested in using it, __especially researchers working on CubeSats!__. <br />

## Instructions for use

1. This ST code is based on two open softwares usually used in Astronomy: __Source Extractor__ and __Match__. In order to use this program, you need to install this two software.<br />
    1.1. Get and install [Source Extractor.](https://www.astromatic.net/software/sextractor) 
You can find this program in the repository, and install it typing: _sudo apt-get install sextractor_
    1.2. Get and install [Match](http://spiff.rit.edu/match/). We use __version 0.14__ in our program. <br />

2. Clone this repository in any folder on your RPI, for example: __/home/pi/Desktop/Git/ST/__

3. Run in _Python_ the file _StarTracker_10deg.py_ . By default, it will use a picture from __/RPI/Sample_Images/__. Also, you can test it with other pictures, or use your own taked with the RPI Camera.
