# Star Tracker

## Overview

This GitHub contains the Star Tracker (ST) development for SUCHAI 2 - 3. 
SUCHAI 1 is the first NanoSatellite developed by Universidad de Chile, at the 
Space and Planetary Exploration Laboratory (SPEL). Launched on June 23 (2017), 
the satellite is currently operational. Actually, we are working in two more NanoSats, the SUCHAI 2 & 3. <br />
[More info about the SUCHAI proyect](http://spel.ing.uchile.cl).

## Description

- This is a fully functional Star Tracker for use with a Raspberry Pi and its camera. <br />
- This code is written in _Python_. All the code and the necessary files are in the __RPI__ folder. <br />
- This Git-Hub is free and open to everyone interested in using it, __especially researchers working on CubeSats!__. <br />

## Instructions for use

1. This ST code is based on two open softwares: __Source Extractor__ and __Match__. In order to use it, you need to install this two software.<br />
    1.1. Get and install [Source Extractor](https://www.astromatic.net/software/sextractor). 
[This guide](http://wiki.ipb.ac.rs/index.php/SExtractor_installation) could be very useful to install __Sextractor__. <br />
    1.2. Get and install [Match](http://spiff.rit.edu/match/). We use __version 0.14__ in our program. 
Usually, __Match__ is installed without any problems. <br />

2. Clone this repository in any folder on your RPI, for example: __/home/pi/Desktop/Git/ST/__

3. Run in _Python_ the file _StarTracker_10deg.py_. By default, it will use a picture from __/RPI/Sample_Images/__. You can test with other pictures, or use your own taked with the RPI Camera.
